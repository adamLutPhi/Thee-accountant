# Accounting methods

| _Assets = Liability + Capital_ |
this model relies on accumulation of  5 different Accounting Ratios


this model assumes:
-  All data are correct ( no scenario for data manipulation)
-  No additional, Sudden Emergency Cash Inflows (i.e. Bank loans, or bonds )

hence, this model is, by no means, realistic, or suitable for the real world
