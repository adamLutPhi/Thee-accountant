```
a(n) Abstract `seed` of idea
that has value

value
is a value fixed (or changing?)
what changes in a value

definitely:
    Any `thing` : requires time & effort

    effort: could be the production material the `thing` is made of

how is a value related to an idea?
(Realizing) the relation is where the bottle neck is

is there something else (you could think of ?)
```
struct Value <: idea

    time::DateTime #estimated time - how much time spent (is it kuantifiable?, monitizable?)
    effort 
end
