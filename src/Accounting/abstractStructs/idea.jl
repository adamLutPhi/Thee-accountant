what makes an idea Value-Able?
<needs time to ponder upon>

it's not valuable on its own (per se)

but it's the value, in the Relation it has
to other ideas

 - an idea , stems from ... Nothing (or is it a `Complex Plane` ?....)
Q. is an idea fixed (or changing?)


there must be a meta-idea : explaining an idea

an idea is indifferent on its own; it makes no Difference ....
so...*Ponders....*

what makes an idea, an idea?
```

struct idea <: Nothing # is it nothing, or something.. of value??
    ```
    is it nothing, in the real plane, or in the complex plane
    (before that) where does the real plane start, & the complex plane meet with it?
    
        that is the question
    
        an idea is a thing you can't grasp...
    
    ```

    #space , is it/


    ϕ::nothing
    ϵ=10^-6 # is it a smallest thing - of value 


end
